This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
--First, clone the project repository to your local machine:
# bash
Copy code
git clone [(https://github.com/akashjoarder18/transaction-app.git)]
cd <project-folder>

2. Install Dependencies
--Install all necessary packages by running:
bash
Copy code
npm install


3. Set Up PostgreSQL Database
--Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your machine.
--If the project has specific database setup instructions (such as creating specific tables), refer to the --project’s documentation.

Create a PostgreSQL database for this project:
# sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE my_database;
Replace my_database with the name expected by the project.

4. Configure Environment Variables
The project should contain an .env.example file. Copy this file to create your own .env file:

# bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Open the .env file and update the DATABASE_URL variable with your PostgreSQL credentials:

env
Copy code
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/my_database"
Replace username, password, localhost, 5432, and my_database with your PostgreSQL information.

5. Run Prisma Migrations
After setting up the environment variables, apply the Prisma migrations to set up the database schema:
bash
Copy code
npx prisma migrate deploy
This command will execute any migrations that have been created for the project.

6. Generate Prisma Client
Run this command to ensure the Prisma Client is up to date with the database schema:
bash
Copy code
npx prisma generate

7. Start the Development Server
Finally, run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Additional Notes
Seeding the Database: If the project requires initial data, check if it has a seeding script (usually in prisma/seed.js). Run it with:

bash
Copy code
npx prisma db seed
Testing API Routes: You can test the API endpoints with tools like Postman or directly from the application’s frontend.
